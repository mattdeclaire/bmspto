            <h2>Viking Night</h2>
            <p>BMS Viking night will be held Friday, October 18 from 5 - 8pm on the BMS campus. The event will feature food trucks, inflatable obstacle courses, a teacher-led auction, and live performances by our talented students.</p>
            <p>To keep this event free for our families, we need your support. We are seeking sponsorships to cover the costs of the game area and additional lighting. Your tax-deductible contribution will help us achieve this goal and ensure Viking Night remains accessible to all. Without sufficient funds, we may need to charge for access to some activities.</p>
