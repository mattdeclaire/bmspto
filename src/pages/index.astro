            <p>A direct do nation to the PTO is a great way for families to help who don't have the time to take on other projects. Contribution, no matter the size, will directly impact our students' education and overall experience at BMS.</p>

            <h2>Viking Night</h2>
            <p>BMS Viking night will be held Friday, October 18 from 5 - 8pm on the BMS campus. The event will feature food trucks, inflatable obstacle courses, a teacher-led auction, and live performances by our talented students.</p>
            <p>To keep this event free for our families, we need your support. We are seeking sponsorships to cover the costs of the game area and additional lighting. Your tax-deductible contribution will help us achieve this goal and ensure Viking Night remains accessible to all. Without sufficient funds, we may need to charge for access to some activities.</p>
