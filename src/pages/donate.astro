    <h2>We need your support!</h2>
    <p>We start the year with a donation drive - the idea is simple, fundraise in the easiest way possible!</p>
    <p>Let's get real. We all lead busy lives! Most families do not have the time for PTO meetings, helping with a bunch of fundraisers, or selling stuff we don't really need. A direct donation to the PTO is a great way for families to helpwho don't have the time to take on other projects.</p>
    <p>Contribution, no matter the size, will directly impact our students' education and overall experience at BMS.</p>
    <p>2023-24 needs:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>All events and activities from the 2022-23 list</li>
        <li>Gardening supplies, math games, classroom supplies</li>
        <li>Display cases for student art, sound equipment for drama, and updated PE equipment</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Our goal is to raise $30,000 total for the year</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>$30</b> - If all families donate just $30, we can do most of what we organized and funded last year!</li>
            <li><b>$50</b> - Larger donations get us closer to adding a spring family event and funding more instructional grants for teachers!</li>
            <li><b>$100</b> - Reduce the need for teachers and leadership to do independent fundraisers in the future!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Can you donate more, or less? Or course! We know every family's situation is unique and no donation is too small.</p>
        <p>Remember to check if your employer offers donation matching! The United Way and Benevity both have BMS PTO as a group you can donate to.</p>
        <p>You can donate here on the web, or bring cash or checks to the main office.</p>
        <p><b>Remember! We are a 501(c)3 charitable organization. So, your donation is tax deductible.</b></p>
