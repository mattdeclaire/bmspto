            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>The vision of the Benicia Middle School PTO is to promote a community where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Parents are informed and involved</li>
                <li>Teachers are empowered to deliver the richest education possible</li>
                <li>Children have access to resources that keep them engaged, stimulated and excited to learn</li>
                <li>The PTO will aim to ensure that every student is known, valued and nurtured in order to reach their fullest academic and social-emotional potential</li>
                <li>Membership is open to all parents and teachers at BMS and there is no membership fee</li>
                <li>We are an independent non-profit and not politically connected to any outside organization</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We can focus all of our funds and attention on the unique needs of our school community!</p>

            <h2>Viking Night</h2>
            <p>BMS Viking night will be held Friday, October 18 from 5 - 8pm on the BMS campus. The event will feature food trucks, inflatable obstacle courses, a teacher-led auction, and live performances by our talented students.</p>
            <p>To keep this event free for our families, we need your support. We are seeking sponsorships to cover the costs of the game area and additional lighting. Your tax-deductible contribution will help us achieve this goal and ensure Viking Night remains accessible to all. Without sufficient funds, we may need to charge for access to some activities.</p>
